 <h1>IBBIT NATION'S FAVORITE MOVIES!!!!</h1>
 <h2>yea here's my top 3 that I can think of off the top of my head</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Bullet Train</h3>
 <p>
    I thought this movie was hilarious. I normally don't tune in for a lot of live-actions films but this one lowkey got me interested in just a few minutes. 
    It came up on Netflix and my cousins liked it so I gave it a go!!!!

  <h3>Dragon Ball Super: Broly</h3>
 <p>
    Nothing beats the theatre experience I had with this anime movie. I've seen a lot of taco hotdog hamburger movies but this was like if the taco was from the hidden alleys of Manalisco alongside hotdogs of the golden porks and hamburgers from beyond the world.

  <h3>Pixels</h3>

    I don't actually like this movie that much I just couldn't think of 3. Adam Sandler was in it I think
